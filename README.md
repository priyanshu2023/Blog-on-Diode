Diode:

If we start with the definition, we can call diode a small electronic device in which current flows in only one direction.

How does a diode look like?

Above you can see an overview of how diodes look like. They come in different sizes, shapes, colours, material. There are
various kinds of diodes & you must have seen a few of them at some point of your life.

Here is a basic Diagram of a diode for better understanding

As you can see the positive terminal is the anode while the negative terminal is cathode.
We use diode to control the direction of current in a circuit.


Conditions for electric current flow in a diode:

* Forward Bias : In this condition the diode allows the electric current to flow through it and acts as a conductor.
* Reverse Bias : In this condition the diode doesnâ€™t allow the electric current to flow through it and acts as an insulator.

Diodes explained:

Diode is a semi-conductor device. Because semiconductors can act as both a conductor and an insulator.
Pure Silicon has almost no free electrons, so what engineers do is dope the silicon with a small amount of another material
to change the properties. We call it P-Type and N-Type Doping.
We combine these two materials and form a basic diode. The 2 materials join together to form a P-N JUNCTION. At this
junction we get a region called the depletion region. This is the region where some of the excess electrons from the n-type
side will move over to occupy the holes in the p-type side.

DIODES ARE GENERALLY MADE FROM TWO MATERIALS:
SILICON & GERMANIUM
 Si Ge
The basic difference between silicon diode & germanium diode is that silicon diode has a high forward voltage and hightemperature stability than a germanium diode.

Types of Diode:

1. Zener diode
2. PN junction diode
3. Avalanche diode
4. Light Emitting Diode
5. Schottky diode
6. Photodiode
7. Laser diode


Zener Diode:

Zener diodes are operated in reverse bias & break down on reaching a certain voltage. If current passing through the
resistor is limited a stable voltage is generated. Zener diodes are used in power supplies to provide a reference voltage.


PN Junction Diode:

P-N junction diode is a rectifier diode. These diodes are used for the rectification process & are made of semiconductor
material. The P-N junction diode includes 2 layers of semiconductors. One layer of the semiconductor material is doped
with P-type material while the other layer with N-type material. The combination of these P and N-type layers form a
junction called as the P-N junction. Thus, the name is P-N junction diode.
